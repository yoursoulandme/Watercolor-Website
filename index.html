        Food is such an integral part of our lives and our culture. We eat to
        celebrate important moments, discover new things, bring ourselves
        comfort, and evoke familiar memories. Watercolor is perfect for food
        illustration and is the medium illustrator Enya Todd uses to create
        everything from editorial work for publications to packaging designs.
        She has worked for clients like British Airways and shares her work with
        over 45K followers on Instagram.
